# Solita_Project
 
Welcome to Solita_Project. This was created for the purposes of a simple demonstration.

Little details about the project.
This project is using backend technology using Java and MySql and JSP, and front end technology using html and javascript.
Java loads csv files into a mysql database, it fetches data from the database and then using JSP it transfers the data to an htmk page (well, technically a jsp file is a html file).
