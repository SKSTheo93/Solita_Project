# Solita_Project
 
Welcome to Solita_Project. This was created for the purposes of a simple demonstration.

Little details about the project.
This project is using backend technology using Java and MySql and JSP, and front end technology using html and javascript.
Java loads csv files into a mysql database, it fetches data from the database and then using JSP it transfers the data to an html page (well, technically a jsp file is a html file).

I used the Eclipse Editor. I created a Maven project which uses jsp technologgy and through a tomcat apache server the webpages are loading.

To anyone who is curious about the basics of using Java, mysql, jsp, html and javascript and how can be connected together feel free to download the files.
Hovewer there a a few steps to do (like downloading other stuff. But it's quite easy... i think... XD)

1) Download Oracle JDK from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
